* `firebase-admin` integration
* Huge App Example with passing of props to child routes

* Loading Decorator (with custom loading indicator config)

### Long Term
* Routing decorators (most likely to include `@AuthRequired` and `@RedirectOnAuth`)
* Optional Built in Role Management
* Multi-level population
* Population rules suggestion/generation
